  <p>I had to deal with the
	  following most recently:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><p>ARPACK: I had to go grab mpif.h from the openmpi/include directory and put it into
		the directory instructed by ARmake.inc<p></li>
	    <li>Other minor annoyances I had to track down and fix.</li>
	    <li>Ultimately, this script will hang on the trilinos build. To build trilinos individually, do
	      the following:</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Go to a scratch area on your machine. /scratch or someplace where there is
		plenty of disk space.</li>
	      <li>Make a build directory for trilinos there, like mkdir trilinos_build</li>
	      <li>cd trilinos_build</li>
	      <li>cp $GOMA_ROOT/Key-linux-mpi-cmake-script .</li>
	      <li>Modify all of the library locations as necessary in
		this script.
		Specifally pay attention to the
		fortran library. It worked better when I just set
		this directly to the library path:</li>
	      <pre>FORTRAN_LIBS=”/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64_linux_/4.4.4/libgfortran.a”</pre>
	      <li>Make sure all other cmake directives are pointing to
		the correct libraries. They may be a lot of them.</li>
	      
	      <pre>
sh key-linux-mpi-cmake-script
make (this takes about 2 hours)
make install</pre>
	      
	      <p>note that you may want to rerun the linux script if
	      libraries are updated/changed. Reissuing a make just
	      picks up where it left off.
	      Also, if an error is
	      persistent in the cmake step, blow away the entire
	      build directory and create a new one and start over
	      with the updated script.</p>

	      <li> Ignore this error:</li>
	      <pre>rm: cannot remove `CMakeCache.txt': No such file or directory</pre>

	    </ul>
	    <p>There were a couple headers files (umfpack.h and amd.h) that were missing from the amesos
	      source directory which prevented amesos from building. I had copy them over from the UMFPACK
	      and AMD directories.</p>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
