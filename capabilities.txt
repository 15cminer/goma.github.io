Goma’s significant capabilities include:
• Unprecedented flexibility for mixing and matching physics and physical-chemical
interactions between material domains. Prototypical Goma 6.0 applications
are direct-numerical simulation of a liquid drop impacting a porous substrate
or deposition and drying of polymeric and sol-gel coating solutions. These
are processes common in the ink-jet printing and adhesive/decorative coating
technologies.

Fully-coupled thin-region shell-element capability for fluids, structures (beam,
bar, membrane elements), and other surface mechanics and transport (heat
transport, surface species). Applications include machine lubrication design,
thin film wiping flows (painting, doctoring), and laser-surface processing and heat treatment.

Fully-coupled porous-media transport capability, with multi-region porouscontinuum
compatibility.

Complex rheology including yield stress, shear thinning, and viscoelastic fluids
with thermal or chemical-dependent properties. Modeling the rheology of
particle-filled polymers is one of Goma’s strengths.

Solid material models for complex behavior including elasto-viscoplasticity and
nonlinear Hookean response.

• Extensive diffusion/reaction models for electrochemical processes (corrosion,
battery performance, electroplating, etc.).

• Bio-inspired applications for particle-phase including independent motion from
the bulk fluid to hydrophobicity similar to lily pads.

Advanced capabilities allowing for easy implementation of design constraints
(augmenting conditions based on any combination of fluxes, forces, primitive
variables), sensitivity analysis, operating window calculation (linear stability
analysis and automated multi-parameter continuation), and pixel/voxel-tomesh
translators

All these and more capabilities are integrated in Goma’s fully coupled finite
element framework.
